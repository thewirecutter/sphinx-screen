Sphinx is a repository used for PR review interview questions.

Welcome to the Wirecutter PR Review exercise! We are so glad you're here!

First off, we know interviewing is a stressful process. Deep breath. We will try to make this as comfortable as possible for you. Treat your interviewer as you would a co-worker, ask them questions, clarifications, and be honest if you get stuck! We are not looking for the specific 'right' answers here, but getting a sense of how you communicate technical ideas, work with others, and general face code reviews. 

In this repo you will see 2 files:
- api.php
- client.js

You will also see a PR in the Pull Requests tab to update the Product API to add the PUT operation.

Your job is to review the PR! Assume it is working code and completes all the requirements for the feature. Help your theoretical co-worker tighen up their code in any way you think is helpful - readability, understanding, effeciency, or quality.  Speak your thought process outloud and use the interviewer for guideance, questions, or to bounce ideas off of!
